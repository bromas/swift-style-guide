# Mokriya's Swift Style Guide

## Motivation

We created this style guide to keep the code in our applications and code reviews consistent. This document will be changed when there's valid reason to change it, and all of us should try to follow those guidelines. If we can all read and understand each other's code without discussing style it's time we all save.

## Goals

Our overarching goals are conciseness, readability, and simplicity.

## Credits

This style guide was initialy inspired by [raywenderlich's](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).
